                    <p>The Leveraged Freedom Chair (LFC) is an all-terrain wheelchair designed for rural areas of developing countries. The key innovation behind the LFC is its single-speed, variable mechanical advantage drivetrain. The user propels the chair by pushing on the levers; gasping high increases torque, while grasping low increases speed. The drivetrain geometry was optimized considering human power and force capabilities, user physiology, and terrain types found in the developing world. This simple system achieves a 3:1 change in mechanical advantage, enabling LFC users to travel 80% faster and produce 50% higher peak wheel torque than they could with a conventional wheelchair. All moving parts on the LFC are made from bicycle parts found anywhere in the world, making the LFC locally repairable and comparable in price to other wheelchairs available in developing countries. The LFC is in production in India and can be purchased through Global Research Innovation and Technology (GRIT).</p>

                    <p>The technology enables a deaf child or adult, develop near normal speech by giving the user visual feedback of his speech efforts on a smart phone like device, thus using their naturally heightened visual processing skills to develop speech. The visual feedback substitutes the absent auditory feedback in deaf people that prevents them from developing speech. Results have been astounding. This has never been done before anywhere in the world. International patent application for See Sound Live has been completed in 2019 by 4S Medical Research P Ltd. See Sound Live has the potential to become for the deaf, what Braille is today for the blind.

                <p>Scientists have found a way to decode brain signals into speech </p> <br>
                <p>It’s a step towards a system that would let people send texts straight from their brains.
                    You don’t have to think about it: when you speak, your brain sends signals to your lips, tongue, jaw, and larynx, which work together to produce the intended sounds. Now scientists in San Francisco say they’ve tapped these brain signals to create a device capable of spitting out complete phrases, like “Don’t do Charlie’s dirty dishes” and “Critical equipment needs proper maintenance.” The research is a step toward a system that would be able to help severely paralyzed people speak—and, maybe one day, consumer gadgets that let anyone send a text straight from the brain. A team led by neurosurgeon Edward Chang at the University of California, San Francisco, recorded from the brains of five people with epilepsy, who were already undergoing brain surgery, as they spoke from a list of 100 phrases.
