                    <p class="description-text"> India has around 14% of the population suffering from some kind of disability (around 17 crores). It is most unfortunate that over 71% are unemployed and are totally dependent on their family for sustenance.  Most companies think that PWDs cannot contribute like their abled counterparts. <br>
                        Although sometimes it is difficult for a PWD to work (due to severity of the disability), however, often we can provide PWDs with the right tools, apps, equipment so that they can overcome their disability and employ themselves. 
                        We at Prototypic Solutionsâ€™s PWD Division offer services for Persons With Disabilities (PwDs). 
                        We help PwDs- <br>
